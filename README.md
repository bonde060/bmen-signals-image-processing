# Gait Analysis Project
Source code for video and image processing. 
Used to extract walking behavior based on pressure heatmap from the feet. 
Time-series image analysis done in MATLAB extracts key features from pressure points in the feet. 
ML model predicts likelyhood of injury based on gait.
See final poster for comprehensive walk-through.
